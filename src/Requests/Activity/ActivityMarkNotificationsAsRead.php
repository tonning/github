 * Marks all notifications as "read" for the current user. If the number of notifications is too large
 * to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted` status and GitHub will run an
 * asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read." To check whether any "unread" notifications
 * remain, you can use the [List notifications for the authenticated
 * user](https://docs.github.com/rest/activity/notifications#list-notifications-for-the-authenticated-user)
 * endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.
