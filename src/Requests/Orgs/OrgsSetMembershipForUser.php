/**
 * orgs/set-membership-for-user
 *
 * Only authenticated organization owners can add a member to the organization or update the member's
 * role.
 *
 * *   If the authenticated user is _adding_ a member to the organization, the invited user will
 * receive an email inviting them to the organization. The user's [membership
 * status](https://docs.github.com/rest/orgs/members#get-organization-membership-for-a-user) will be
 * `pending` until they accept the invitation.
 *
 * *   Authenticated users can _update_ a user's
 * membership by passing the `role` parameter. If the authenticated user changes a member's role to
 * `admin`, the affected user will receive an email notifying them that they've been made an
 * organization owner. If the authenticated user changes an owner's role to `member`, no email will be
 * sent.
 *
 * **Rate limits**
 *
 * To prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50 organization
 * invitations per 24 hour period. If the organization is more than one month old or on a paid plan,
 * the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour period.
