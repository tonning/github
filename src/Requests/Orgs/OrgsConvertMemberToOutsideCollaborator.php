 * When an organization member is converted to an outside collaborator, they'll only have access to the
 * repositories that their current team membership allows. The user will no longer be a member of the
 * organization. For more information, see "[Converting an organization member to an outside
 * collaborator](https://docs.github.com/articles/converting-an-organization-member-to-an-outside-collaborator/)".
 * Converting an organization member to an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise
 * administrators. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your
 * enterprise](https://docs.github.com/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."
