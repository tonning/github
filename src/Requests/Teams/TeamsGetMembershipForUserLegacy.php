/**
 * teams/get-membership-for-user-legacy
 *
 * **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We
 * recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Get team membership for a
 * user](https://docs.github.com/rest/teams/members#get-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint.
 *
 * Team
 * members will include the members of child teams.
 *
 * To get a user's membership with a team, the team
 * must be visible to the authenticated user.
 *
 * **Note:**
 * The response contains the `state` of the
 * membership and the member's `role`.
 *
 * The `role` for organization owners is set to `maintainer`. For
 * more information about `maintainer` roles, see [Create a
 * team](https://docs.github.com/rest/teams/teams#create-a-team).
