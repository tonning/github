 * teams/remove-repo-in-org
 *
 * If the authenticated user is an organization owner or a team maintainer, they can remove any
 * repositories from the team. To remove a repository from a team as an organization member, the
 * authenticated user must have admin access to the repository and must be able to see the team. This
 * does not delete the repository, it just removes it from the team.
 *
 * **Note:** You can also specify a
 * team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `DELETE
 * /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/repos/{owner}/{repo}`.
