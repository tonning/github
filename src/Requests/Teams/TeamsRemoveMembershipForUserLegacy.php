/**
 * teams/remove-membership-for-user-legacy
 *
 * **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We
 * recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Remove team membership for a
 * user](https://docs.github.com/rest/teams/members#remove-team-membership-for-a-user) endpoint.
 *
 * Team
 * synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information,
 * see [GitHub's products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
 * in the GitHub Help documentation.
 *
 * To remove a membership between a user and a team, the
 * authenticated user must have 'admin' permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization that
 * the team is associated with. Removing team membership does not delete the user, it just removes
 * their membership from the team.
 *
 * **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with
 * your organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for
 * making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP,
 * you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and
 * removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between
 * your identity provider and
 * GitHub](https://docs.github.com/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
