/**
 * teams/remove-membership-for-user-in-org
 *
 * To remove a membership between a user and a team, the authenticated user must have 'admin'
 * permissions to the team or be an owner of the organization that the team is associated with.
 * Removing team membership does not delete the user, it just removes their membership from the
 * team.
 *
 * Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more
 * information, see [GitHub's
 * products](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub
 * Help documentation.
 *
 * **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your
 * organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for
 * making changes to the team's membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP,
 * you can manage GitHub team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and
 * removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between
 * your identity provider and
 * GitHub](https://docs.github.com/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."
 *
 * **Note:**
 * You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `DELETE
 * /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.
