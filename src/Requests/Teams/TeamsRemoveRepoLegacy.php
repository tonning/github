 * recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [Remove a repository from a
 * team](https://docs.github.com/rest/teams/teams#remove-a-repository-from-a-team) endpoint.
 *
 * If the
 * authenticated user is an organization owner or a team maintainer, they can remove any repositories
 * from the team. To remove a repository from a team as an organization member, the authenticated user
 * must have admin access to the repository and must be able to see the team. NOTE: This does not
 * delete the repository, it just removes it from the team.
