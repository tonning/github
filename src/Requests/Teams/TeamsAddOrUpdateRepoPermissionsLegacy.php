/**
 * teams/add-or-update-repo-permissions-legacy
 *
 * **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We
 * recommend migrating your existing code to use the new "[Add or update team repository
 * permissions](https://docs.github.com/rest/teams/teams#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions)"
 * endpoint.
 *
 * To add a repository to a team or update the team's permission on a repository, the
 * authenticated user must have admin access to the repository, and must be able to see the team. The
 * repository must be owned by the organization, or a direct fork of a repository owned by the
 * organization. You will get a `422 Unprocessable Entity` status if you attempt to add a repository to
 * a team that is not owned by the organization.
 *
 * Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters,
 * you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information,
 * see "[HTTP
 * method](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#http-method)."
