/**
 * checks/create
 *
 * Creates a new check run for a specific commit in a repository.
 *
 * To create a check run, you must use
 * a GitHub App with the `checks:write` permission. OAuth apps and authenticated users are not able to
 * create a check suite.
 *
 * In a check suite, GitHub limits the number of check runs with the same name
 * to 1000. Once these check runs exceed 1000, GitHub will start to automatically delete older check
 * runs.
 *
 * **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or
 * check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an
 * empty `pull_requests` array.
