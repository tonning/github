/**
 * migrations/update-import
 *
 * An import can be updated with credentials or a project choice by passing in the appropriate
 * parameters in this API
 * request. If no parameters are provided, the import will be restarted.
 *
 * Some
 * servers (e.g. TFS servers) can have several projects at a single URL. In those cases the import
 * progress will
 * have the status `detection_found_multiple` and the Import Progress response will
 * include a `project_choices` array.
 * You can select the project to import by providing one of the
 * objects in the `project_choices` array in the update request.
 *
 * **Warning:** Due to very low levels
 * of usage and available alternatives, this endpoint is deprecated and will no longer be available
 * from 00:00 UTC on April 12, 2024. For more details and alternatives, see the
 * [changelog](https://gh.io/source-imports-api-deprecation).
