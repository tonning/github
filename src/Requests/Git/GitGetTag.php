 * | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
 * | `verified` |
 * `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
 * |
 * `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are
 * enumerated in table below. |
 * | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the
 * commit. |
 * | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |
 *
 * These are the possible values for
 * `reason` in the `verification` object:
 *
 * | Value | Description |
 * | ----- | ----------- |
 * |
 * `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
 * | `not_signing_key` | The "signing"
 * flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |

 * `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
 * |
 * `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
 * | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP
 * signature was found in the commit. |
 * | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email
 * address in the commit. |
 * | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was
 * associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |

 * made the signature. |

 * found in the signature. |
