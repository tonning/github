/**
 * git/create-tree
 *
 * The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying
 * that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and
 * create a new tree structure.
 *
 * If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents
 * in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For
 * more information see "[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)"
 * and "[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference)."
 *
 * Returns an
 * error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.
