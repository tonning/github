/**
 * search/topics
 *
 * Find topics via various criteria. Results are sorted by best match. This method returns up to 100
 * results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api). See
 * "[Searching topics](https://docs.github.com/articles/searching-topics/)" for a detailed list of
 * qualifiers.
 *
 * When searching for topics, you can get text match metadata for the topic's
 * **short\_description**, **description**, **name**, or **display\_name** field when you pass the
 * `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text
 * match metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).
 *
 * For example, if
 * you want to search for topics related to Ruby that are featured on https://github.com/topics. Your
 * query might look like this:
 *
 * `q=ruby+is:featured`
 *
 * This query searches for topics with the keyword
 * `ruby` and limits the results to find only topics that are featured. The topics that are the best
 * match for the query appear first in the search results.
