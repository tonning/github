/**
 * search/commits
 *
 * Find commits via various criteria on the default branch (usually `main`). This method returns up to
 * 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).
 *
 * When
 * searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for the **message** field when you provide
 * the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see
 * [Text match
 * metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).
 *
 * For example,
 * if you want to find commits related to CSS in the
 * [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository. Your query would look
 * something like this:
 *
 * `q=repo:octocat/Spoon-Knife+css`

	 * @param string $q The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of GitHub. The REST API supports the same qualifiers as the web interface for GitHub. To learn more about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search query](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#constructing-a-search-query). See "[Searching commits](https://docs.github.com/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-commits)" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
	 * @param null|string $sort Sorts the results of your query by `author-date` or `committer-date`. Default: [best match](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#ranking-search-results)
	 * @param null|string $order Determines whether the first search result returned is the highest number of matches (`desc`) or lowest number of matches (`asc`). This parameter is ignored unless you provide `sort`.
	 * @param null|int $page Page number of the results to fetch.
