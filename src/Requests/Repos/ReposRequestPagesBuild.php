 * repos/request-pages-build
 *
 * You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the default branch. This has the
 * same effect as pushing a commit to your default branch, but does not require an additional commit.
 * Manually triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and failures.
 *
 * Build
 * requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and one concurrent build per requester.
 * If you request a build while another is still in progress, the second request will be queued until
 * the first completes.
