/**
 * repos/delete-file
 *
 * Deletes a file in a repository.
 *
 * You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an
 * object containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an `author` parameter, which
 * is an object containing information about the author.
 *
 * The `author` section is optional and is
 * filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted,
 * the authenticated user's information is used.
 *
 * You must provide values for both `name` and `email`,
 * whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status
 * code.
 *
 * **Note:** If you use this endpoint and the "[Create or update file
 * contents](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents/#create-or-update-file-contents)" endpoint in
 * parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these
 * endpoints serially instead.
