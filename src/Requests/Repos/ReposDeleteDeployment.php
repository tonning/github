/**
 * repos/delete-deployment
 *
 * If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment regardless of its status.
 * If the repository has more than one deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This
 * ensures that repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active deployment. Anyone
 * with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete a deployment.
 *
 * To set a deployment as inactive,
 * you must:
 *
 * *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current
 * state, then delete the previously active deployment.
 * *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by
 * adding any non-successful deployment status.
 *
 * For more information, see "[Create a
 * deployment](https://docs.github.com/rest/deployments/deployments/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create
 * a deployment status](https://docs.github.com/rest/deployments/statuses#create-a-deployment-status)."
