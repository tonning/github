/**
 * security-advisories/list-global-advisories
 *
 * Lists all global security advisories that match the specified parameters. If no other parameters are
 * defined, the request will return only GitHub-reviewed advisories that are not malware.
 *
 * By default,
 * all responses will exclude advisories for malware, because malware are not standard vulnerabilities.
 * To list advisories for malware, you must include the `type` parameter in your request, with the
 * value `malware`. For more information about the different types of security advisories, see "[About
 * the GitHub Advisory
 * database](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database#about-types-of-security-advisories)."

	 * @param null|string $ghsaId If specified, only advisories with this GHSA (GitHub Security Advisory) identifier will be returned.
